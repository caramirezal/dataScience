Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	copy

    shell:
        cat input/hola.txt input/adios.txt > output

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
