Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	copy

rule copy:
    input: input/hola.txt, input/adios.txt
    output: output/hola.txt
    jobid: 0

Error in rule copy:
    jobid: 0
    output: output/hola.txt
    shell:
        cp input/hola.txt input/adios.txt output/hola.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
