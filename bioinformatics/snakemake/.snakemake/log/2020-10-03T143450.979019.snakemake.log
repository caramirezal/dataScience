Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	copy
	1

rule copy:
    input: input/hola_mundo.txt
    output: output/hola_mundo.txt
    jobid: 0
    wildcards: file_name=hola_mundo

[Sat Oct  3 14:34:51 2020]
Error in rule copy:
    jobid: 0
    output: output/hola_mundo.txt
    shell:
        cp input/hola_mundo.txt > output/hola_mundo.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job copy since they might be corrupted:
output/hola_mundo.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
